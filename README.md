# SAT ACT Analysis
SAT and ACT 2017 2018 Analysis

> The new format for the SAT was released in March 2016. As an employee of the College Board - the organization that administers the SAT - you are a part of a team that tracks statewide participation and recommends where money is best spent to improve SAT participation rates. Your presentation and report should be geared toward **non-technical** executives with the College Board and you will use the provided data and outside research to make recommendations about how the College Board might work to increase the participation rate in a **state of your choice**.

### Datasets

#### Provided Data

For this project, we'll have two provided datasets:

- [2017 SAT Scores](./data/sat_2017.csv)
- [2017 ACT Scores](./data/act_2017.csv)

These data give average SAT and ACT scores by state, as well as participation rates, for the graduating class of 2017.

We can see the source for the SAT data [here](https://blog.collegevine.com/here-are-the-average-sat-scores-by-state/), and the source for the ACT data [here](https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-scores-by-state-averages-highs-and-lows).
